Setting up to use ProcessLauncher.exe	
	When using ProcessLauncher you must have a file in the same directory
		location as the ProcessLauncher.exe named launch_commands.txt.
		In the .txt file the file should contain
			ex:
			1,ServerApp.exe,
			1,ClientApp.exe,Username
			1,ClientApp.exe,Username
			.....
		
		You can specify any number of ClientApp.exe to be launched.

Server App Instructions:
	If doing launch without ProcessLauncher then launch Server.exe
		first before launching ClientApp.exe.
		
	NOTE** if the last client sends "quit" message the server will stop 
		recieveing messages and shutdown.
		
Client App Instructions:
	Provide a user identifer name for communication with different clients
		through the server. If no user name is provided the program will
		exit on failure.
		ex: ClientApp.exe Garth
	
	Send any message to the server for other clients to see what you have 
		sent. 
		
	When wanting to quit from the server type "quit" to remove yourself from
		the server and stop sending messages.
